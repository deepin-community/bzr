bzr (2.7.0+bzr6622+brz) unstable; urgency=medium

  Bazaar has been replaced in Debian with Breezy. Breezy is a friendly fork
  of Bazaar that is actively maintained and has been ported from Python 2 to
  Python 3.

  The command-line interface for Breezy is backwards-compatible with Bazaars, and
  it provides the ``bzr'' command for convenience. Breezy will also read
  its configuration from ~/.bazaar, if present.

  Third-party plugins that worked with Bazaar will almost certainly not work
  with Breezy but can be ported with some effort.
